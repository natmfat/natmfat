# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on Gitlocker, a new way to showcase closed-source repositories. I'm also reworking a lot of my old projects, so be sure to be on the look out for some of those.

## Projects

- [blockpit](https://blockpit.natmf.at/): A React-only drag & drop code editor to learn generative art
- [art](https://art.natmfat.com/): Generative art made with p5, Three.js, and TypeScript
- [v0](https://github.com/natmfat/v0): Generative UI; an (old) clone of Vercel's v0
- [banner](https://github.com/natmfat/banner): Banners that make your projects shine
- [shitgen](https://github.com/natmfat/shitgen): A shit PostgreSQL type generator
- [ui](https://ui.natmfat.com/): My personal design system
- [polyprint](https://github.com/natmfat/polyprint): A dead simple schema builder
- [remix-endpoint](https://github.com/natmfat/remix-endpoint): Create Remix actions and loaders with type validation

... and many more!

New projects coming soon with Gitlocker.
