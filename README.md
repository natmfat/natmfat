# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on [Vanilla Libraries](https://github.com/orgs/vanilla-libraries/repositories), which are a set of lightweight and opinionated TypeScript libraries for relatively common tasks, such as generating profile pictures or making a web server.

## Projects

- [Banner](https://github.com/natmfat/banner): Personal project banner generator; can be easily forked & deployed on Vercel for your own use
- [Screen Time](https://github.com/natmfat/screen-time): Track and manage your screen time with machine learning
- [Coloors](https://github.com/natmfat/coloors): Generate color palettes (like coolors but really made as an experiment to learn GraphQL)
- [Shader Playground](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shader-playground): Create basic fragment shaders just like Shader Toy

Some projects are closed source and are only available upon request. I am actively working on improving the code quality of these projects so others can more learn from my work more effectively. For example, I've made

- Blockpit: A React-only drag & drop code editor to learn generative art
- [Creative Coding](https://art.natmfat.com/): Generative art made with p5, Three.js, and TypeScript
